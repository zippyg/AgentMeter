# Antigravity provider

Antigravity supports four usage data sources:

1. The Antigravity 2.0 app's local `language_server` (preferred when the app is open).
2. The `agy` CLI's embedded HTTPS localhost server (preferred over the IDE because it exposes richer quota data).
3. The Antigravity IDE extension `language_server` (used after `agy` CLI because current IDE local payloads only expose session/model quota data).
4. Google OAuth-backed remote usage (explicit OAuth mode, and the account-scoped fallback used for multi-account switching). The OAuth path can store multiple Google accounts through the shared token-account switcher.

The local and CLI paths both prefer Antigravity's internal `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` quota payload and may fall back to
`GetUserStatus`, then `GetCommandModelConfigs`; CodexBar never scrapes the desktop UI or the `agy` TUI.

As of Antigravity 2.x, the Antigravity app and `agy` CLI payloads can be richer than Google OAuth and IDE payloads.
`RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` exposes the same two groups shown by Antigravity's Model Quota UI:

- `Gemini Models`: weekly limit and five-hour limit.
- `Claude and GPT models`: weekly limit and five-hour limit.

Older local payloads may only include raw Claude, GPT-OSS, Gemini tiers, account plan, and session reset timestamps.
Current Antigravity IDE local endpoints return `GetUserStatus`, `GetAvailableModels`, and `GetCascadeModelConfigData`
with five-hour/session reset data, but not the app/CLI `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` weekly/session grouping. OAuth
payloads can be less complete and may only prove model availability. Treat `auto` as the authoritative user-facing mode:
it accepts the first account-matching source in Antigravity app -> `agy` CLI -> Antigravity IDE order, and adds OAuth
when CodexBar has a selected/injected Google account or an existing shared credentials file. An all-100%
`fetchAvailableModels` payload is only accepted after `retrieveUserQuota` echoes bucket fractions; this can be an
availability-style fallback rather than the full Antigravity quota summary.

## OAuth account switching

- Login still uses Antigravity's Google OAuth client, discovered from `Antigravity.app` or overridden with `ANTIGRAVITY_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `ANTIGRAVITY_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- A successful login writes the latest shared credentials to `~/.codexbar/antigravity/oauth_creds.json` and upserts a token-account entry for the Google account.
- Each token-account entry stores serialized `AntigravityOAuthCredentials` and is injected into remote fetches through `ANTIGRAVITY_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_JSON`.
- When a token account is selected, the OAuth fetcher uses that account before falling back to the shared credentials file.
  In `auto` mode the ambient Antigravity app, `agy` CLI, and IDE probes still run first, but a snapshot whose account
  does not match the selected account is rejected so the pipeline falls through to the account-scoped OAuth fetch (see
  `AntigravitySelectedAccountGuard`). If no account is selected/injected, `auto` includes OAuth only when the legacy
  shared credentials file already exists. Explicit `cli`/`oauth` source modes stay authoritative and are not re-checked.
- Removing the last saved token account that matches `~/.codexbar/antigravity/oauth_creds.json` deletes that shared file,
  so a removed CodexBar account does not silently continue refreshing through the legacy shared cache.
- The menu action is labeled `Add Account...`; switching between saved accounts scopes Google OAuth fetches.

## Remote OAuth data sources

- `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:loadCodeAssist`
- `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:onboardUser`
- `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:fetchAvailableModels`
- `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`
- `POST https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` (available, but current observed OAuth
  responses are model-bucket shaped rather than Antigravity 2.0's two quota groups)

## Data sources + fallback order

### 1) Antigravity app local probe

When the Antigravity 2.0 app is running:

1. **Process detection**
   - Command: `ps -ax -o pid=,command=`.
   - The app local strategy scopes detection to the **Antigravity app** language server only
     (`AntigravityStatusProbe(processScope: .appOnly)`). It deliberately does **not**
     attach to an IDE or `agy` CLI process: a lower-information IDE payload should not mask
     `agy`'s richer quota summary, and a stale or still-initializing `agy` can accept the
     connection before it is ready. `agy` is owned exclusively by the CLI HTTPS source below,
     which waits for real API readiness. The probe still classifies all kinds
     (`processInfo(scope: .ideAndCLI)` is used by `isRunning()` for status reporting):
     - the **Antigravity app** language server: process names such as `language_server`, `language_server_macos`,
       `language_server_macos_arm`, or `language-server` plus
       Antigravity markers (`--app_data_dir antigravity`, an Antigravity app bundle path,
       or a path containing `/antigravity/`); or
     - the **IDE** language server: the Antigravity IDE extension language server, usually under
       `Antigravity IDE.app/.../extensions/antigravity/bin/` with `--app_data_dir antigravity-ide`; or
     - the **CLI**: an `antigravity-cli` / `antigravity_cli` path segment, or the
       `agy` binary (path-anchored so unrelated arguments/binaries do not match).
   - CodexBar collects all valid local app language-server candidates and probes each reachable one. If multiple
     app processes are open, it prefers the richer quota-summary snapshot over the legacy `GetUserStatus`
     two-pool fallback.
   - Extract CLI flags:
     - `--csrf_token <token>`. Requirement depends on the match kind:
       - **App/IDE** matches still require it - a tokenless desktop language-server match is
         skipped so a later valid server can be found, otherwise `missingCSRFToken`
         is reported (unchanged behavior).
       - **CLI** matches accept an empty token, because the CLI's language server
         exposes no `--csrf_token` flag and requires none.
     - `--extension_server_port <port>` (HTTP fallback; app/IDE only).
     - `--extension_server_csrf_token <token>` (preferred HTTP fallback token when present).

2. **Port discovery**
   - Command: `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -a -p <pid>`.
   - All listening ports are probed.

3. **Connect port probe (HTTPS)**
   - `POST https://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUnleashData`
   - Headers:
     - `X-Codeium-Csrf-Token: <token>`
     - `Connect-Protocol-Version: 1`
   - First 200 OK response selects the connect port.

4. **Quota fetch**
   - Primary:
     - `POST https://127.0.0.1:<connectPort>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`
   - Fallback 1:
     - `POST https://127.0.0.1:<connectPort>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUserStatus`
   - Fallback 2:
     - `POST https://127.0.0.1:<connectPort>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetCommandModelConfigs`
   - If HTTPS fails, retry over HTTP on `extension_server_port`.

### 2) `agy` CLI HTTPS source

When source mode is `auto` or `cli` and the desktop local probe fails, CodexBar resolves `agy` via:

- `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PATH`
- `PATH` / login-shell path lookup
- Well-known paths:
  - `~/.local/bin/agy`
  - `/opt/homebrew/bin/agy`
  - `/usr/local/bin/agy`

CodexBar launches `agy` in a PTY because the CLI exposes its quota server only while the interactive process is alive.
The implementation still does **not** scrape terminal output; it only keeps the process alive, drains discarded PTY
rendering, discovers listening ports with `lsof`, and probes the local HTTPS server:

- First: `POST https://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`
- Fallback 1: `POST https://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUserStatus`
- Fallback 2: `POST https://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetCommandModelConfigs`

The fallback can return quota without the account email or plan fields from `GetUserStatus`.

Differences from the desktop local probe:

- The CLI HTTPS endpoint does **not** require `X-Codeium-Csrf-Token`.
- Readiness is endpoint-based: CodexBar retries until one of the quota endpoints parses, because fresh `agy`
  processes can bind a port before the quota service is initialized.
- App runtime uses a bounded warm session: `agy` is kept alive briefly after a refresh, then stopped on idle. CLI runtime
  tears it down immediately after the one-shot fetch.
- Repeated endpoint failures force a relaunch instead of reusing a wedged process forever.
- CodexBar records the launched pid + executable identity and conservatively reaps only its own matching stale `agy`
  process on the next launch. It never blind-kills a user-launched `agy`.

### 3) Antigravity IDE local probe

When the Antigravity 2.0 app and `agy` CLI are unavailable, CodexBar probes Antigravity IDE language servers with
`AntigravityStatusProbe(processScope: .ideOnly)`. Current observed IDE payloads return model-level/session quota data
through `GetUserStatus`, `GetAvailableModels`, and `GetCascadeModelConfigData`; `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` returns 404
from the IDE local server. This means the IDE fallback can show session bars, but should not be expected to provide the
weekly limit shown by Antigravity 2.0.

### 4) OAuth remote fallback

When source mode is `auto`, OAuth is used after app, `agy` CLI, and IDE paths fail if CodexBar has a selected/injected
Google account or an existing shared credentials file. The app, `agy` CLI, and IDE probes still run first, but in
`auto` mode their snapshots are accepted only when the reported account matches the selected account; otherwise the
pipeline falls through to this account-scoped OAuth fetch. When source mode is `oauth`, only OAuth is used and the
shared OAuth file can still be used as a fallback credential source.

## Request body (summary)
- Minimal metadata payload:
  - `ideName: antigravity`
  - `extensionName: antigravity`
  - `locale: en`
  - `ideVersion: unknown`

## Parsing and model mapping
- Preferred source fields:
  - `response.groups[].displayName`
  - `response.groups[].buckets[].bucketId`
  - `response.groups[].buckets[].displayName`
  - `response.groups[].buckets[].remaining.remainingFraction`
  - `response.groups[].buckets[].description`
- Legacy source fields:
  - `userStatus.cascadeModelConfigData.clientModelConfigs[].quotaInfo.remainingFraction`
  - `userStatus.cascadeModelConfigData.clientModelConfigs[].quotaInfo.resetTime`
- Preferred quota summary UI:
  - Render `Gemini Session`, `Gemini Weekly`, `Claude + GPT Session`, and `Claude + GPT Weekly` as named windows.
  - Keep Antigravity's bucket description as reset prose; infer `windowMinutes` from the bucket ID/display name.
  - Use the most constrained known bucket as the compact/menu-bar metric.
- Legacy user-facing quota groups:
  - `Gemini` groups Gemini Pro and Gemini Flash text models.
  - `Claude + GPT` groups Claude text models and GPT/GPT-OSS text models.
- Representative selection:
  - Hidden model rows such as Lite, autocomplete, and image variants do not drive summary bars.
  - For each group, CodexBar uses the lowest remaining known quota row and preserves that row's reset metadata.
  - Rows with reset metadata but no remaining fraction stay visible as unavailable reset context only when their group
    has no known usage row.
- `resetTime` parsing:
  - ISO-8601 preferred; numeric epoch seconds as fallback.
- Identity:
  - `accountEmail` and `planName` only from `GetUserStatus`.

## UI mapping
- Provider metadata:
  - Display: `Antigravity`
  - Labels: `Gemini` (primary), `Claude + GPT` (secondary)
- Status badge: Google Workspace incidents for the Gemini product.
- Antigravity exposes many model rows, but current local payloads show them collapsing into two real usage pools:
  Gemini and Claude/GPT. Detailed usage should not list every raw Gemini tier unless a future source exposes a genuinely
  distinct unknown or consumed quota window.
- Some Antigravity local/CLI model config entries include reset metadata but omit `remainingFraction`. Those windows stay
  in `extraRateWindows` for reset context and are marked with `usageKnown: false`; clients should not render their
  `usedPercent` as a real exhausted quota.

## Constraints
- Internal protocol; fields may change.
- Requires `lsof` for local/CLI port detection.
- Local HTTPS uses a self-signed cert; the probe allows insecure TLS only for loopback hosts.
